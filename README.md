# Applying Differential Privacy in predicting Age, Gender and Ethnicity 
# Debsankar Mukhopadhyay

A privacy-preserved approach powered by differential privacy to a multivariate model has been presented to predict Age, Gender, and Ethnicity from human facial images. While minimizing the contributions of the individual attributes of the face images and, thereby, introducing privacy to the individualized training data, the modelâ€™s accuracy is found to be nominally affected using the privacy algorithm. 

A demo of the software and step-by-step process to produce the results is here:
